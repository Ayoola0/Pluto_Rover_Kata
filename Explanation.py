I first want to define all possible movement, with consideration for different starting positions and directions
I kept start position as user input
I gave the user ability to change the position and direction( only one at a time) 
I became aware of the need to creat a map/grid
I went on to learn how to create a grid (see grid.py)
I tried to learn to how traverse the grid to no avail
I understand theoretically how wrapping works but not how to implement it in code form eg
On a 4 x 4 grid, if the rover is sitting at (0,4,N), an 'F' command should place it on (0,0,N)
Upon further research, I learned I will need to use 'class'
This is something I have not yet come across, nor was I able to understand it
As I want this to be a true reflection of my current ability, I opted out of using it
I have added Object Oriented Progamming to my personal development timetable to help me better understand to to approach problems like this
Upon learning about Test Driven Developmemt, I quickly became aware of a higher proficiency of python that I am eager but yet to attain.
I have now decided to sign up for Python classes offline so i can learn with some structure
